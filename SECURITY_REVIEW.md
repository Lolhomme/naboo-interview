# Security Review and Improvements

## Critical Security Issues Fixed

### 1. Authentication & JWT Security
- **Fixed:** Improved cookie security settings with `secure`, `sameSite: 'strict'`, and proper `maxAge`
- **Fixed:** Removed insecure localStorage JWT storage in favor of httpOnly cookies
- **Fixed:** Removed unnecessary JWT token storage in user database records
- **Fixed:** Enhanced password validation with complexity requirements (min 8 chars, uppercase, lowercase, number)
- **Fixed:** Improved error handling to prevent information leakage about user existence

### 2. Rate Limiting
- **Added:** Global rate limiting (10 requests per minute per IP)
- **Added:** Specific rate limiting for authentication endpoints:
  - Login: 5 attempts per minute
  - Registration: 3 attempts per minute

### 3. Input Validation & Sanitization
- **Enhanced:** Activity creation input validation with length limits and character restrictions
- **Enhanced:** Stronger validation patterns to prevent injection attacks
- **Improved:** Better password validation with complexity requirements

### 4. Security Configuration
- **Updated:** JWT expiration time reduced from 31 years to 24 hours
- **Improved:** Increased bcrypt salt rounds from 10 to 12 for better password hashing
- **Fixed:** Missing type definitions causing build failures

## Remaining Security Recommendations

### High Priority
1. **Environment Configuration**
   - Set strong JWT secrets in production (current .env.dist has examples)
   - Configure proper FRONTEND_DOMAIN for production
   - Use HTTPS in production environments

2. **Database Security**
   - Add database connection encryption
   - Implement database query logging for security monitoring
   - Consider database connection pooling limits

3. **Additional Authentication Features**
   - Implement account lockout after multiple failed attempts
   - Add email verification for registration
   - Consider implementing refresh tokens for better session management
   - Add password reset functionality with secure token generation

### Medium Priority
1. **API Security Headers**
   - Add security headers middleware (helmet.js)
   - Implement CORS configuration review
   - Add request size limits

2. **Monitoring & Logging**
   - Implement security event logging
   - Add monitoring for suspicious activities
   - Consider implementing audit trails

3. **Data Validation**
   - Add input sanitization for rich text fields
   - Implement file upload security if added later
   - Consider implementing request/response size limits

### Low Priority
1. **Additional Security Features**
   - Consider implementing API rate limiting per user
   - Add request signing for critical operations
   - Implement session invalidation on password change

## Security Testing Recommendations

1. **Automated Security Testing**
   - Add security-focused unit tests
   - Implement integration tests for authentication flows
   - Consider adding OWASP dependency checks

2. **Manual Security Testing**
   - Perform penetration testing on authentication flows
   - Test rate limiting effectiveness
   - Verify CSRF protection

## Code Quality Improvements Made

1. **Type Safety**
   - Added missing City type definition
   - Fixed React hooks dependency warnings

2. **Error Handling**
   - Standardized error messages for security
   - Improved error handling patterns

3. **Code Consistency**
   - Improved validation patterns across the application
   - Enhanced input sanitization approaches
